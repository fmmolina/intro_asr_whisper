1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No scientist has enjoyed such global popularity.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
She was the first to investigate the phenomenon of radioactivity

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and discovered unknown radioactive elements for science.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
She was the first woman to do her PhD at Sorbonne,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the first woman to win the Nobel Prize,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the only one to receive the prestigious award twice.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Her name was Maria Słodowska-Kury.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She was born in Warsaw in 1867,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
in the womb of a family dedicated to teaching.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Słodowskis tried to instill in their five children

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
a love for knowledge.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Exact sciences were especially valued in that house.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
At 16, Maria left the institute, graduating with a degree of honour.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In Poland, which at that time was part of the Russian Empire,

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
there were no institutions where women could continue to study,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and her family had no money to send their daughters to study abroad.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Then Maria proposed that her older sister should go to study in Paris,

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and said that she would pay for her studies

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
by working as an institute teacher at a landlady's house.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Eight years later, Maria had saved enough money

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to go to Paris to study at the University of Sorbonne.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She lived in a small village, where the heat was unbearable in summer,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and so cold in winter that the water froze in the washroom.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maria lived on bread and tea,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but she had managed to study at the famous university,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and she made it her goal to dedicate her life to science.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
While looking for a laboratory for her research,

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the young 27-year-old Slodoska met Pierre Curie,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
a well-known physicist.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They soon got married.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Their union, based on common points of view and interests,

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
turned out to be strong and harmonious.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Three years after the wedding, her first daughter, Irene, was born.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
At the end of the 19th century,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
important events took place in the field of physics.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In 1895, the German physicist Röntgen reported

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
that he had discovered a new type of penetrating rays,

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
later called X-rays.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A year later, the Frenchman Becquerel found out

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that the minerals contained in uranium emitted

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
a powerful radiation of an unknown origin.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Slodoska Curie began to study that phenomenon

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that should be called radioactivity.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Pierre joined his experiments,

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
leaving his own experiments with crystals.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In 1898, the Curie couple declared

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
that they had discovered two very radioactive elements.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Using the right given to her by being her discoverer,

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Maria proposed that one of them be called Polonium,

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in honor of her native Poland,

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and the other one be called Radio.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
However, discovering the existence of new elements

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
was not enough.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They had to be isolated.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
To carry out the experiments,

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the Curie couple obtained permission to use

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
a spare cover used in those days by medical students.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The experiments to isolate the radioactive elements

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
lasted for four years.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It is a tiring job, Maria Curie wrote.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You have to transport mineral bags,

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
pour solutions from one container to another,

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
stir the boiling liquid in a jar of molten iron for hours.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The titanic effort was crowned with success.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In 1902, scientists obtained

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
a decigram of pure radio chloride.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The appearance of that white powder

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
was similar to that of table salt,

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but the light radiating from it was so bright

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that it could be read near the tubes

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
in which the radio salt was stored.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Impressed by the extraordinary work of the physicists,

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Vladimir Mayakovsky later compared

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the process of obtaining radio with poetry.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You have to work a whole year to get a gram.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Despite its precarious nature,

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the scientists did not patent their discoveries.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Marie said,

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the radio should not enrich anyone.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This element belongs to the world.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For their work on radioactivity,

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Marie and Pierre Curie were awarded

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A year later, Eve, her second daughter, was born.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And two years later, in 1903,

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Pierre Curie died rolled up by the wheels of a heavy cart.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The hard blow of fate

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
would not discourage Marie.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It happened to her husband in the physics class of the Sorbonne,

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
contributing to the creation of the Institute of Radio in Paris,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and was appointed director of the Radioactivity Laboratory.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In 1911, Marie Curie received her second Nobel Prize,

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
this time in chemistry.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
During the war, Marie Curie was killed by a bomb.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
During the war, Marie Curie was director

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
of the Department of Radiology of the Red Cross

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and worked in field hospitals.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She learned to drive and, when necessary,

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
she was also a mechanic.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In her youth, she had endured the cold

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
that was in her lap.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then she carried out laborious experiments

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
in a cover that was not suitable for a laboratory.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But it was her calm and determination that characterized her.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Marie Slodowska Curie died as a result

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
of the radiation received at 66 years old.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
of the radiation received at 66 years old.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The radioactive rays she investigated throughout her life

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
managed to undermine her health,

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
causing a leukemia that would have caused her death.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The most advantaged students of Marie Curie

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
were her eldest daughter Irene and Frédéric Joliot Curie,

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1935

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:46,000
for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.
